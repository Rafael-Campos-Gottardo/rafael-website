summary: Poster presented at CPSA 2023.
abstract: 'Using the ideational approach, some research claims populist ideas are present at the individual level, where populist attitudes exist independent of traditional left-right ideological cleavages. However, studies of populist leaders with strong ideological positions argue that fundamental attitudes do little to predict support for populist leaders when controlling for ideology. Here, we test the role of populist attitudes in predicting support for centrist populists such as El Salvadorâ€™s centrist populist president Nayib Bukele. This study uses the 2018 LAPOP AmericasBarometer (N = 484) to examine the effect of ideology, views on democracy, perceptions of crime, and core ideational populist attitudes on support for Bukele, all the while controlling for common socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, sex). We hypothesize that populist attitudes can predict support for Bukele even when controlling for ideology, which would suggest that populist leaders need not rely on right- or left-wing appeals.'
