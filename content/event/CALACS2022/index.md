summary: Paper presented at the CALACS Congress 2022.
abstract: 'In 2020 El Salvador’s populist president Nayib Bukele became infamous for his authoritarian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast to most Latin American populist leaders, who had a lax response to the pandemic, Bukele responded by imprisoning individuals who violated public health guidance (Smith, 2020). Most studies examine Bukele’s authoritarian COVID-19 response without drawing a connection between his authoritarian actions and his populist ideas (Hallock & Call, 2021). This paper examines Bukele’s COVID-19 response to determine how Bukele’s populist ideology and discourses influenced his pandemic response. Specifically, the ideational approach which understands populism as a set of ideas related to “the people” in opposition to “the elite” is used to examine Bukele’s discourses on Twitter and in speeches (Hawkins & Rovira Kaltwasser, 2019). When examining Bukele’s discourses during the pandemic, it is evident that he referenced “the people” in opposition to “the elite” and another group of “corrupt people.” This form of discourse is consistent with Brubaker’s (2017) definition of populism and a form of punitive populism (Osuna, 2020). Using the ideational approach to study populism explains how Bukele justified authoritarian behaviour against certain societal groups (who broke lockdown requirements) that he deems hurt the interests of the people. Public opinion data support his discourse with 23.9% of Salvadoran respondents indicating that COVID-19 was the most important issue in their country in 2021 (LAPOP, 2021). This study explains why populists had authoritarian responses to the pandemic and provides a more nuanced explanation for the relationship between populism and authoritarianism in El Salvador. Bukele’s intensive justification and dehumanization of individuals who did not follow public health restrictions are the result of his belief that their actions hurt “the people.” Therefore, Bukele believes that he must use his executive power in the interests of the “pure and uncorrupted people” (Mudde, 2004).'
